    "The typical example of this is probably [Turkish](http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/turkish-i18n.html): Their alphabet has lower-/uppercase version of a dotless i (ı/I) and a dotted i (i/İ). Those are different sounds - in other words, upper/lowercasing words in a non locale-aware way results in a wrong word:"
