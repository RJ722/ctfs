It's written by [Pentagrid](https://www.pentagrid.ch/) (a Swiss security company), and [xorkiwi](https://twitter.com/xorkiwi) (the author) is from Switzerland as well (maybe even working there?). Seems like a great starting point!\n",

    "Thanks to the `unescapeJava` call, we can use an input like `\\u0000` to insert a null byte into the trie. That didn't work, but I was pretty sure I was on the right track, everything just fit together nicely.\n",
    "\n",
